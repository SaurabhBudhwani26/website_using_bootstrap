            <h1>Comics</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Comics Blog!</p>
            <p>Comics is a medium used to express ideas with images, often combined with text or other visual
                information. It typically takes the form of a sequence of panels of images. Textual devices such as
                speech balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other
                information. The size and arrangement of panels contribute to narrative pacing. Cartooning and other
                forms of illustration are the most common image-making means in comics; fumetti is a form that uses
                photographic images. Common forms include comic strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books.
                Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, comic albums, and tankōbon have
                become increasingly common, while online webcomics have proliferated in the 21st century</p>

            <p>The English term comics is used as a singular noun when it refers to the medium itself (e.g. "Comics is a
                visual art form."), but becomes plural when referring to works collectively (e.g. "Comics are popular
                reading material."). Though the term derives from the humorous (comic) work that predominated in early
                American newspaper comic strips, it has become standard for non-humorous works too. The alternate
                spelling comix – coined by the underground comix movement – is sometimes used to address these
                ambiguities.[1] In English, it is common to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used
                in their original languages, such as manga for Japanese comics, or bandes dessinées (B.D.) for
                French-language comics. There is no consensus amongst theorists and historians on a definition of
                comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some sequentiality or other image relations,
                and others historical aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters. The
                increasing cross-pollination of concepts from different comics cultures and eras has further made
                definition difficult.</p>

        <p>Text is frequently incorporated into comics via speech balloons, captions, and sound effects. Speech balloons
            indicate dialogue (or thought, in the case of thought balloons), with tails pointing at their respective
            speakers. Captions can give voice to a narrator, convey characters' dialogue or thoughts, or
            indicate place or time. Speech balloons themselves are strongly associated with comics, such that the
            addition of one to an image is sufficient to turn the image into comics. Sound effects mimic non-vocal
            sounds textually using onomatopoeia sound-words</p>

        <p>Cartooning is most frequently used in making comics, traditionally using ink (especially India ink) with dip
            pens or ink brushes; mixed media and digital technology have become common. Cartooning techniques such
            as motion lines and abstract symbols are often employed</p>
